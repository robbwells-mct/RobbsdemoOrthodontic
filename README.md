## 🔧 Configuration

### Application Settings
The application runs on port 5001 by default. To change this, modify the last line in `orthodontics_app.py`:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, port=5001)  # Change port here
```

### Data Storage
- Patient data is stored in `orthodontics_data.json`
- The file is automatically created when you first add data
- Data persists between application restarts
- For production use, consider migrating to a proper database
